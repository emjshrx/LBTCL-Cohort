## About
Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line is a comprehensive tutorial series that teaches you how to use Bitcoin Core through the command line. The series covers all the
essential Bitcoin operations that can be performed using the bitcoin-cli and a local bitcoind regtest node. Starting from basic transaction construction to advanced scripting,
this tutorial is a must-read for aspiring Bitcoin developers.

Upon successful completion of the cohort program, participants will receive a certificate recognizing their proof-of-work.

## Prerequisites
Participants are expected to have a basic knowledge of Bitcoin and familiarity with terminal operations. Prior to joining the cohort, it is recommended to cover the material
in the book [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) and become comfortable with [Unix/Linux command-line terminals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA).

## Cohort Overview
The cohort program will comprehensively cover chapters 1 to 13 of [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).
This provides participants with a solid foundation in Bitcoin operations through the command line.

After the cohort, participants are encouraged to independently explore chapters 14 to 20, which delve into the advanced functionalities of Bitcoin Core. This will allow them
to further explore more advanced topics like programmatically interfacing with bitcoin-cli and the lightning network.

The structure of the cohort program is designed for self-study. Each week, participants will be assigned to a group to receive questions related to the scheduled chapters.
Participants are expected to study the material, prepare answers to their questions, and actively participate in the weekly group discussion sessions, where they will explain
their answers to other participants.

Following the group discussion, Bitshala Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be available for doubt-clearing sessions, providing an opportunity to ask additional questions and
clarify any doubts that arose during the study session.

After the group session, participants will be given programming exercises based on the weekly study content. Participants are expected to complete and submit the exercises
within the designated timeframe.
